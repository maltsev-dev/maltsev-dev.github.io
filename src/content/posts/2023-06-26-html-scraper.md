[📚 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/maltsev-dev/html_scraper_template)

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline of working with web data using Java and Spring Boot. It fetches raw HTML from a given URL, extracts relevant information, maps it to structured Java objects (POJOs), and writes the results into an `.xls` Excel file.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Spring Boot** – main application framework
* **Jsoup** – HTML parsing
* **Apache POI** – Excel file generation
* **Spring Configuration** – flexible setup via `application.properties`

---

## 🚀 Features

1. **Fetch HTML content**
   Makes a `GET` request to the target URL and retrieves the HTML response.

2. **Parse HTML with Jsoup**
   Uses Jsoup to create a `Document` object and navigate the DOM.

3. **Map to POJO objects**
   Extracted data is converted into Java classes for easy manipulation.

4. **Export to Excel (XLS)**
   Generates a formatted `.xls` spreadsheet using Apache POI.

5. **Configurable via properties file**
   Keywords and target URL can be defined in `application.properties`.
