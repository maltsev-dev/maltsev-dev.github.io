üü† What is a general purpose input output (GPIO) of the MCU

<!-- more -->
---

### GPIO

GPIO stands for general purpose input/output. It is a type of pin found on an integrated circuit that does not have a specific function.  
While most pins have a dedicated purpose, such as sending a signal to a certain component, the function of a **GPIO pin is customizable** and can be controlled by the software.  

It can work as:
üì• Input (reads logical signals, such as from a button)  
üì§ Output (controls something - LED, relay, motor)  
üîÑ Sometimes - both as an input and as an output (push-pull)  

### Pin 
**Pin Mode** : Each port bit of the general-purpose I/O (GPIO) ports can be individually configured by software in several modes:
* input or output
* analog
* alternate function (AF).
**Pin characteristics** :
* Input : no `pull-up` and no `pull-down` or pull-up or pull-down
* Output : `push-pull` or `open-drain` with pull-up or pull-down capability
* Alternate function : push-pull or open-drain with pull-up or pull-down capability.

### GPIO Design

Each GPIO pin of the microcontroller consists of **three key components**:  
{{ img(src = "/images/emb/gpio_design.png") }}

1.  **Enable Line**

* Configures the pin mode: `input`, `output`, `alternate function`, `analog`, etc.
* Controls the activation of internal pull-up resistors
* Enables/disables **input/output buffers** and logic enable

2.  **Output Buffer**

* It is a combination of **two transistors (PMOS + NMOS)**
* In **Push-Pull** mode both can work
* In **Open-Drain** only `NMOS` is active
* Allows to output logic levels to an external pin

When the signal `0` comes out, control goes through the `NMOS` transistor and no logical one is supplied to the pin.  
{{ img(src = "/images/emb/output_buffer_zero.png") }}
When the signal `1` comes out, control goes through the `PMOS` transistor and a logical one is supplied to the pin.  
{{ img(src = "/images/emb/output_buffer_one.png") }}

3. **Input Buffer**

* Monitors the signal level on the pin
* Can be **enabled or disabled** - for example to disable reading during output
* Used to read logic level or generate interrupts

When a `0` signal is received on the pin, control passes through the `NMOS` transistor and goes to `GND`  
{{ img(src = "/images/emb/input_buffer_zero.png") }}
When a `1` signal is received on the pin, control passes through the `PMOS` transistor and is powered from `+VCC`

### ‚öôÔ∏è GPIO Modes

* **By default** all GPIOs on most microcontrollers are configured in **Input mode**.
* In this mode they are **not connected to either Vcc or GND** - the pin is in the **High Impedance (Hi-Z)** state.
* This means that the **GPIO is not "involved" in the circuit's operation**, but may be subject to **noise and flow currents**, especially if the input is left "floating".

| Mode | Description | Example |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Input** | Reading signal from outside | Button, sensor |
| **Input Pull-Up** | Input with pull-up to Vcc (internal resistor) | Button to GND |
| **Input Pull-Down** | Input with pull-up to GND | Button to Vcc |
| **Output Push-Pull** | Normal output (0 or 1) | LED, relay |
| **Output Open-Drain** | Only "0", "1" ‚Äî via external resistor | I¬≤C, external bus |
| **Analog** | ADC/DAC is used on the output | Temperature sensor, audio |
| **Alternate Function** | Used by peripherals (SPI, PWM, UART) | SPI, I¬≤C, PWM |

If we wanted to use some Pin as an input, we would use either `.into_pull_up_input()`, `.into_pull_down_input()` to tell the chip to expect the system voltage (3.3 volts) to be `present` or `absent`, and react if that changes.

```rust
// RP2040 (Rust embedded-hal, hi-Z)
    _pin_28.into_pull_down_input(); // Set GPIO 28 as input with pull-down
    _pin_28.into_floating_input(); // Set GPIO 28 as floating input
    _pin_28.into_pull_up_input(); // Set GPIO 28 as input with pull-up

    _pin_28.into_pull_up_disabled(); // Disable pull-up on GPIO 28
    _pin_28.into_pull_down_disabled(); // Disable pull-down on GPIO 28

    _pin_28.into_push_pull_output(); // Set GPIO 28 as push-pull output
```

## Output

### Push-Pull

* GPIO uses **two transistors**: **PMOS** (to supply "1") and **NMOS** (to supply "0").
* In Push-Pull mode, the pin can actively:
    * Supply the line with **logical 1 (Vcc)** via PMOS
    * Supply **logical 0 (GND)** via NMOS
* This is the standard mode for driving LEDs, relays and other loads.

### Open-Drain

* In this mode, GPIO **can only short the pin to ground (0)** via **NMOS**.
* Internal **PMOS is missing** or disabled ‚Üí you **cannot** apply "1" directly.
* When GPIO is driven to logic "1" ‚Üí transistor **is off** and pin becomes **floating**.
* To make the line to be logic "1", a **pull-up resistor** is used:
    * **Internal** (enabled by software if available)
    * **External** (usually 4.7k‚Äì10k Ohm to Vcc)

Useful when
When need a **common bus** with **many devices** connected to it. (All participants can **only "pull down"** to avoid conflict)
