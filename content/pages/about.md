## Who I am

- 🟠 Advocate of **Sustainable Programming** — clarity, maintainability, and long-term thinking
- 🟠 Research-oriented engineer with a strong learning mindset  
- 🟠 Creative technologist with interests spanning AI, software, hardware, and visual domains

This space is where I document my work, break down real engineering problems, and reflect on the process of learning and building complex systems — from low-level constraints to high-level architecture.
