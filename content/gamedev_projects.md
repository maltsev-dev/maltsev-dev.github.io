## My Journey into Unreal Engine

* I get truly excited when I can make a computer perform magic that I can touch, see, and interact with. This passion has reshaped my interests and motivated me to dive deeper into game development.

* Starting out, I lacked a clear roadmap on how to make pixels move at my command. To tackle this, I enrolled in several popular online courses, which allowed me to learn effectively and create three full-featured games, each with unique mechanics and level design.

* Every project starts with an idea that leads me to carefully select textures, materials, and assets, testing countless options to find the perfect fit. Scene creation, lighting control, sound design, post-processing effects, landscapes, and level layouts all feed my creative drive and encourage experimentation.

* After weeks immersed in documentation, tutorials, and AI-assisted learning, I gained a solid understanding of how C++ code interacts with the game engine and in-game objects.

* Stepping beyond dry tutorials, I discovered how small parameter tweaks could generate new enemy behaviors, obstacles, and dynamic playgrounds, making development exciting and rewarding.

* Behavioral trees are fundamental for bringing game characters to life. Designing state machines, transitions, and animations lets me create immersive, reactive game worldsâ€”a breakthrough that significantly enhanced my projects.
