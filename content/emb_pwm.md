üü† How to handle pulse width modulation

<!-- more -->
---

**PWM (pulse width modulation)** is used to control the power supplied to the load.

üî∏ **Classic method** - reducing the voltage through a rheostat or potentiometer.  
üîª Disadvantage: inefficient, since part of the energy is lost as heat.  

üî∏ **PWM method** - supplying voltage in short pulses with a fixed amplitude.  
Instead of changing the voltage, the **duty cycle** changes:  
* More on time ‚Üí more power  
* Less on time ‚Üí less power  

This control method is efficient and causes almost no losses.  

### Brief

- mainly used to control the power supplied to the device.
- in some cases it can be used to transmit information for configuring the device.
- has a low power loss and the ability to digitally/software control.

It has 2 main parameters
* **Frequency** (switching frequency, `Hz`),
* **Duty cycle** (percentage of time in "HIGH" state, from `0% `to `100%`).

### Duty cycle
- Percentage of time during which the **signal is active**
    * signal with 20% duty cycle is active 20% of the time
    * signal with 50% duty cycle is active 50% of the time
    * signal with 80% duty cycle is active 80% of the time

* The duty cycle can be set or controlled in `3 main ways`
    * Manual method (Use various knobs or sliders)
    * Automatic (for example, using feedback on the output voltage in a pulse power supply)
    * Software (using some kind of intelligent system that changes the pulse width depending on external logic or parameters)

#### Average voltage level
PWM - often used to vary power by changing the `average voltage level` across a load.
* average load = `peak voltage`(5V) * `duty cycle`(20%) = 1V

### Switching Frequency
- Switching frequency, which is defined as the reciprocal of the time between the leading edges of the voltage pulses.
- The required switching frequency depends on the load or application area
    * can be from `10H`z to several `kHz`
    * for applications where faster or more precise control is required - **higher** switching frequencies are used
    * but in most applications the switching frequency **is fixed**
- Signals can have the same duty cycles, but different switching frequencies

### Examples of PWM Systems
| System | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Visual Devices** | ‚óè Screen brightness control (high frequency to avoid flickering)<br>‚óè RGB LED color control |
| **2. Audio** | ‚óè Digital to analog conversion via filtering<br>‚óè Use efficient Class D amplifiers |
| **3. Switching Power Supplies (SMPS)** | ‚óè The basis of switching converters<br>‚óè Use MOSFETs to switch pulses |
| **4. DC Motors** | ‚óè Fan or pump speed control<br>‚óè Lower duty cycle ‚Üí lower speed<br>‚óè Inertia smooths out operation |
| **5. Servos** | ‚óè PWM sets position, not speed<br>‚óè Pulse width corresponds to deviation from neutral<br>‚óè Power is supplied via a separate channel |
| **6. Inverters (DC‚ÜíAC)** | ‚óè Generating an alternating signal from PWM pulses |
| **7. Chargers** | ‚óè Charging batteries (including from solar panels)<br>‚óè PWM regulates average voltage to prevent overcharging and reverse current |

## üß± Embedded Rust approach:

1. HAL library (e.g. `stm32f1xx-hal`, `rp2040-hal`, `esp32-hal`) provides API to peripherals.
2. `PWM` is usually implemented via **timers (TIM)**.
3. Each `PWM` channel is assigned a `GPIO` pin and a timer.

## üî® General flow of creating PWM in Rust

1. Access `PWM` slices (`Slices::new`)
2. Configure `PWM7` (it controls `GPIO15` pin)
3. Configure channel B of this `PWM` (channel connected to `GPIO15`)
4. Connect `GPIO15` to `PWM` as **output**
5. In the loop, change the duty cycle value to get the breathing effect

## üí° Implementation: RP2040

```rust
use rp2040_hal::{self as hal, pwm::Slices};

    // PWM Slices Init
    let pwm_slices = Slices::new(pac.PWM, &mut pac.RESETS);
    // Get 7th slice (controls GPIO 14 (A) and GPIO 15 (B))
    let mut pwm_slice = pwm_slices.pwm7;

    pwm_slice.set_ph_correct(); // Phase correct mode = smoother signal
    pwm_slice.set_top(255); // 8-bit duty cycle precision
    pwm_slice.enable(); // enable slice

    // Get channel_b from 7th slice
    let mut channel_b = pwm_slice.channel_b;
    // Make channel_b output to 15th pin
    let _pin = channel_b.output_to(pins.gpio15);

    let mut duty: i16 = 0;
    let mut step: i16 = 1;

    loop {
        let _ = channel_b.set_duty_cycle(duty as u16);
        timer.delay_us(1000);

        duty += step;
        if duty >= 255 || duty <= 0 {
            step = -step;
        }
    }

```

## üß∞ Tips for working with PWM

* **Do not exceed the frequency** - some devices work up to `1-10 kHz`.
* **PWM resolution** depends on the timer (8/10/12/16 bit).
* For **multi-channel PWM** use different channels of the same timer or timers.
* Use a **logic analyzer** or **oscilloscope** for visualization.
* Timers often work asynchronously - glitches at startup are possible.
* For **silent PWM** (LED) use frequencies > `1 kHz.`
